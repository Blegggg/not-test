General knowledge (might move into specific areas)
Produce a detailed proposal for a digital solution that you would develop to meet the needs of the scenario, should provide a rationale for the solution and include:

1- the business context - SWOT anaylsis and stakeholder shenanigans go in this section

2- the functional and non functional requirements of the solution

3- decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the function and non functional requirements
Decomposition of the problems is essential for the success of the digital solution, this is because it allows us to break it into more manageable chunks and then create a solution to resolve the problem. For both logging in and creating an account, there is a potential risk and problem with data security and integrity, this means that if not handled correctly, the data can be compromised by several things, these being a breach of data and then it is modified, or just general data mismanagement. The consequences of not following this is being held accountable for failure to follow the general data protection regulation, which will result in legal troubles as well as reputational damage. Therefore, the log in system must have several areas to account for, these being a general entering of details.

4- KPI's and user acceptance criteria for proposed solution

5- justification of how the reccomended solution meets needs of clients and users, how risks will be mitigated, how relevant regulatory guidlines and legal requirements in relation to software development and the education sector will be addressed.

User needs and client requirements
1- Stakeholder analysis: identify and evaluate intrests and influence of all parties involved in a project to ensure their needs are addressed.

2- User persona development: detailed profile of target users, get this from research to understand their behaviour, needs and motivation.

3- Use case scenarios: Specific examples of how users will interact with the product or service to clarify functionality and benefits.
